## 📝 CLIENT CONSULTATION SCRIPT

### Opening (2 minutes):
"Thanks for taking my call. I help Texas property owners access federal grants that cover 80% of EV charging station installation costs. Most property owners don't know these programs exist, which is why I'm reaching out."

### Qualification Questions (3 minutes):
1. "Where is your property located?" (Check distance to highway)
2. "What type of property is it?" (Gas station, hotel, retail, etc.)
3. "Do you own or lease?" (Must be owner or have owner consent)
4. "Do you have parking spaces available?" (Need 2-4 spaces)
5. "What's your electrical service?" (We can assess, but good to know)

### Value Proposition (3 minutes):
"Here's how it works:
- NEVI program covers 80% (that's typically $80K-$100K)
- Federal tax credit covers another 30%
- With utility rebates, your net cost can be ZERO
- We handle ALL the paperwork - you just sign
- Timeline is 60-90 days from application to operational
- Once installed, you generate revenue from charging fees"

### Next Steps (2 minutes):
"If you're interested, our next step would be a free site assessment where we:
- Confirm your electrical capacity
- Identify optimal charger locations  
- Provide a detailed quote
- Start the grant application

Does that sound good? When would work for a site visit?"

## 🚨 COMMON OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES

### "Sounds too good to be true"
**Response:** "I understand - it does sound amazing! But this is federal policy to accelerate EV infrastructure. The government allocated $5 billion through the Infrastructure Act. The money is real and available now. Want to see the official TxDOT website?"

### "I don't have time for government paperwork"
**Response:** "That's exactly why we exist. We complete 100% of the paperwork. Your only job is to sign the application. We handle everything else - forms, documentation, follow-up, everything."

### "What if my grant is denied?"
**Response:** "We have a high approval rate because we pre-qualify properties and know exactly what grant administrators want. But if it happens, we help you reapply or find alternative funding. With our success fee option, you only pay if the grant is approved - zero risk."

### "I don't want to offer public charging"
**Response:** "That's required for NEVI-funded chargers. But think of it as a revenue stream - you set the pricing. Many property owners charge $0.35-0.50 per kWh and generate $500-2,000 per month per charger. It pays for itself quickly."

### "How much maintenance is required?"
**Response:** "EV chargers are like ATMs - minimal maintenance. SK Signet chargers have a warranty, and we offer maintenance packages. Most owners spend less than $100/month on maintenance per charger."

### "Can I install just 1 charger?"
**Response:** "NEVI requires minimum 4 DC fast chargers per site. But for Level 2 chargers using tax credits only, you can start with 1-2. We can design a phased approach - start small, expand later."
