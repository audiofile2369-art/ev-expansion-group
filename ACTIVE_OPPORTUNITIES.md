## 🎯 REALISTIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU (New Company)

### Start Here (Easier Entry):
1. **Subcontract on NCTCOG projects**
   - Prime contractors need installers
   - $12M available = lots of work to go around
   
2. **Partner with property owners for TxDOT NEVI grants**
   - They apply, you install
   - 80% covered by grant
   - Win-win partnership
   
3. **Direct to businesses using TxVEMP grants**
   - Market your "grant assistance + installation" package
   - You handle everything
   
4. **Respond to DFW Airport Sources Sought**
   - Even if you don't win prime, get your name known
   - Could lead to subcontracting

### Avoid For Now (Until you have past performance):
- Prime contractor on large federal contracts
- Multi-year maintenance agreements (until cash flow is solid)
- Projects requiring bonding over $100K

## 🚨 WHY YOU'RE NOT FINDING CONTRACTS ON SAM.GOV

### The Reality:
1. **Most Texas EV work is STATE/LOCAL managed**
   - TxDOT manages NEVI (not direct federal contracts)
   - Cities manage their own programs
   - Regional COGs like NCTCOG coordinate

2. **Grant-based, not contract-based**
   - Property owners apply for grants
   - They hire installers (YOU)
   - Not traditional government contracts

3. **SAM.gov is for DIRECT federal purchases**
   - DoD, GSA, VA buying directly
   - Texas EV work flows through state agencies

4. **Timing**
   - Federal funding = released to states
   - States = create grant programs
   - Grants = awarded to property owners
   - Property owners = hire you

### The Better Strategy:
✅ **Partner with grant applicants** (businesses, cities, nonprofits)  
✅ **Subcontract on large projects** (NCTCOG, TxDOT programs)  
✅ **Monitor state/local portals** (not just SAM.gov)  
✅ **Offer turnkey "grant + install" service**

## 💡 KEY INSIGHT

**The money is flowing RIGHT NOW**  
**BUT it's through GRANTS, not traditional contracts**

Your strategy should be:
1. Help clients GET grants
2. Be the installer they hire with grant money
3. Build relationships with grant administrators
4. Subcontract on large projects

Traditional federal contracts on SAM.gov will come LATER (6-12 months) once you have:
- Past performance references
- Completed projects
- Government relationships
- Bonding capacity

**For NOW: Focus on grant-funded installations!**

---

## 📞 CONTACTS TO MAKE

1. **TxDOT NEVI:** TxDOT_NEVI@txdot.gov
2. **NCTCOG Clean Cities:** (817) 695-9232
3. **DFW Airport Procurement:** Via DemandStar portal
4. **BidPrime Support:** Help finding relevant bids

---

**BOTTOM LINE:** The opportunities are HUGE, but they're structured differently than you expected. Success = positioning yourself as the go-to installer for grant-funded projects, NOT waiting for traditional government contracts on SAM.gov.

**Let's crush it! 🚗⚡**
