## RED FLAGS TO AVOID

2. ❌ **Don't skip insurance** - one lawsuit can bankrupt you
3. ❌ **Don't overpromise on timelines** - permits can delay projects
4. ❌ **Don't buy too much inventory upfront** - start lean
5. ❌ **Don't ignore contracts** - always have signed agreements before starting work
6. ❌ **Don't forget about prevailing wage requirements** on federal jobs
7. ❌ **Don't neglect documentation** - government contracts = lots of paperwork
